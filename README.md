### Thoughts on Link's Awakening DX (created Feb. 22, 2024)

Link's Awakening DX was the second Zelda game I have ever played, the first being LoZ Ocarina of Time on the N64. Despite the major graphics differences
between the 3d television experience, being able to carry my adventures on Koholint Island with me made this one of my all-time favorite games. Even today, nearly
3 decades later I continue returning to this gem. As I have continued to play this game repeatedly over the years my thoughts and experiences change with each
playthrough along with major events in my own life. This game acts as a nice hermeneutic reference point for examining the stages of my life and I would like to share 
some of those here.

Maybe someone, somewhere will find these interesting.
