### Thoughts on Link's Awakening DX (created Feb. 22, 2024)

Link's Awakening DX was the second Zelda game I have ever played, the first being LoZ Ocarina of Time on the N64. Despite the major graphics differences
between the 3d television experience, being able to carry my adventures on Koholint Island with me made this one of my all-time favorite games. Even today, nearly
3 decades later I continue returning to this gem. As I have continued to play this game repeatedly over the years my thoughts and experiences change with each
playthrough along with major events in my own life. This game acts as a nice hermeneutic reference point for examining the stages of my life and I would like to share 
some of those here.

Maybe someone, somewhere will find these interesting.

#### The experiment or practice in consistency.

I would like to be more consistent on both writing and relaxing, so I came up with an experiment. Every evening I will take 10 minutes to play Link’s Awakening. Not with the intention of speed running to complete the game.
Simply exploring depending upon the current impulse or sense of direction.

Once this is complete, I will restart my clock and take 10 minutes to record my thoughts and reflections on the game. The final outcome should, hopefully, be regular updates and reflections posted in quick intervals. The final result
should also show how much time/many days this playthrough takes.

**Day 1: Feb 22 00:00:00 — 00:10:00**

I loaded up my copy of Link’s Awakening DX in my original GBC, and was pleasantly surprised to see, yet again, that my original childhood save file is still present.
A fun fact about the history of this specific cartridge and its saved states is that although I have completed the game multiple times, that original save file never saw the game to completion. 
That iteration of Link, named “LINK” or "Thief" by the shopkeeper, is still waiting to defeat the final boss of Dungeon 8 Turtle Rock.

I booted a fresh save slot, slot 3 has become my customary destination for new games as slot 2 is my original save state and slot 1 is too far in to erase. Anywho, after mashing through the cut scene and getting my shield, I took a detour through the starting town. It was interesting to note that, so far, only the children have a meta knowledge of the game's mechanics. I also just realised that all of the children in the starter town belong to Papahl and his wife. I always assumed these were non-related characters.

I then beelined for the beach to pickup my sword. Then it was straight into the Lost Woods. I got the Sleepy Toadstool and ran to Hazel the Witch’s Hut. I don’t remember if that is actually her name, but it fits. I returned to the racoon, doused him with powder, and he turned back into Talin.

Moving one screen up I opened the chest and got the Tail Key. **At this point my ten minutes were up.**

I am surprised by the amount of narration pointing you in the right direction. It would be interesting to create a version of LADX with this dialogue removed. I remember most of the game and where I need to be, but it would be an interesting future experiment to remove any directional hints and see how that impacts the experience of exploring Koholint Island.

From looking through the various texts in the LADX disassembly, it shouldn’t be difficult to edit these to simply describe things rather than provide hints. For example, upon opening the chest containing the Tail Key, we are told which dungeon it opens and pointed in its direction. It would be far more exciting if upon lifting the key from its chest, we are only given a short description of what LINK is seeing.

Sidenote: There are many online discussions about the nature of the island and the mystery of the Windfish, but I like to think that Malin is secretly at work here trying to slow your progress, but not being malevolent enough to directly harm the player. The monsters of the game don’t want Link to awaken the fish and destroy the dream — their existence — but what about Marin and the other villagers? Maybe she was with Talin and egged him to take a bite, turn into a raccoon, in a passive attempt at slowing the player.
